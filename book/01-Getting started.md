## Creating a GitHub repository

Visit [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new) and enter a name like `hello-codebook` and check **Add a README file**, then click **Create repository**.

Run `git clone https://github.com/<you>/hello-codebook` then `cd hello-codebook`.

Use your favorite text editor to make the following directory structure:

```
book/
  info.json
  README.md
```

```commit
initialize
```

> You might have noticed that the directory name here is `book2/`. That's because this guide itself is written as a CodeBook, so the `book/` directory is already being used! Ignore the `2` suffix and make sure your repository has a `book/` directory.
